## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark slate blue (#3B4252) to emulate the original's professional and tech-oriented feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#ECEFF4), slightly desaturated from the primary, providing a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: A muted blue (#81A1C1), analogous to the primary but lighter, to highlight key interactive elements and sections.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text.
- Use simple, consistent icons in a similar style to the original site, focusing on clarity and easy recognition. The weight of strokes should be uniform across all icons.
- Replicate the original's grid layout, focusing on a clean, structured presentation of information. Maintain spacing and proportions similar to the original.
- Subtle, smooth transitions for interactive elements. Focus on non-distracting, professional animations for loading and state changes.
